			Welcome to the Object Teams tutorial.
			It will help you build a small Object Teams program.
			You will create an <b>Object Teams project</b>, a <b>Base class</b>,
			a <b>Team class</b> and a <b>Role class</b> which contains two
			kinds of bindings: a <b>callout binding</b> and a <b>callin binding</b>.
			Let's get started!

			param1="org.eclipse.objectteams.otdt.ui.OTJavaPerspective"/>
		<description>
			Select <b>Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;Object Teams</b> in the menubar at
			the top of the workbench. This step changes the perspective to
			set up the Eclipse workbench for Object Teams development. You can
			click the "Click to Perform" button to have the "Object Teams"
			perspective opened automatically.

			The first thing you will need is an Object Teams project. If you
			already have an Object Teams project in your workspace that you
			would like to use, you may skip this step by clicking the
			"Click to Skip" button. If not, select <b>File-&gt;New-&gt;Project...</b>
			and choose <b>Object Teams Project</b> in the list. Complete the subsequent
			pages as required. The "New Object Teams Project" wizard will be automatically
			displayed when you click the "Click to Perform" button.
			After creating the project, it will appear in the <b>OT Package Explorer</b>
			view. Select the project by clicking it with the mouse, so that the next actions
			will know that they apply to this project.

		<description>
			You should now have an Object Teams project in your workspace. The
			next step in building your Object Teams application is to first
			create a normal (Base) class. You may do this by either clicking 
			the "Click to Perform" button below to launch the "New Java Class"
			wizard, or you may use the Eclipse tools to do it, by using the 
			<b>File-&gt;New-&gt;Class</b> action. Name your class for example
			"<b>MyBase</b>". If you do not use the "Click to Perform" button below,
			click the "Click to Skip" button to advance to the next step in
			building your Object Teams application.

	<item
		title="Add two methods to your Base class">
		<description>
			Now that you have your MyBase class, add, e.g., the following two
			methods:
			<br/><b>public void hello() { System.out.println("Hello"); }</b><br/>
			and
			<br/><b>public String getWorld() { return "World"; }</b><br/>
			and save your changes. The first method will be used in a callin binding,
			the other in a callout binding. These bindings will be members of a
			Role class which you are going to create in a minute. Click the 
			"Click to Complete" button below when finished.

		title="Create a Team class"
		skip="true">
		<action
			pluginId="org.eclipse.objectteams.otdt.ui"
			class="org.eclipse.objectteams.otdt.internal.ui.wizards.OpenTeamWizardAction"/>
		<description>
			The next step in building your Object Teams application is to create a
			Team class, which is going to be the enclosing context for the Role class.
			You may do this by either clicking the "Click to Perform" button
			below to launch the "New Team Class wizard", or you may use the Eclipse
			tools to do it, by using the <b>File-&gt;New-&gt;Team</b> action.
			Name your class, e.g. "<b>MyTeam</b>". If you do not use the "Click to Perform"
			button below, click the "Click to Skip" button to advance to the next
			step in building your Object Teams application.

		<action
			pluginId="org.eclipse.objectteams.otdt.ui"
			class="org.eclipse.objectteams.otdt.internal.ui.wizards.OpenRoleWizardAction"/>
		<description>
			The next step in building your Object Teams application is to create a
			Role class for the previously created Team class.
			You may do this by either clicking the "Click to Perform" button
			below to launch the New Role Class wizard, or you may use the Eclipse
			tools to do it, by using the <b>File-&gt;New-&gt;Role</b> action.
			Name your class, e.g. "<b>MyRole</b>".	Enter the name of the enclosing Team
			you have created before, in this case "MyTeam". Now bind the Role class to
			your previously created Base class, either by typing in its name ("MyBase")
			into the designated input field, or by choosing the Base class after clicking 
			the "Browse..." button next to the input field.	If you do not use the "Click
			to Perform" button below, click the "Click to Skip" button to advance to the
			next step.

	<item
		title="Add two methods and two different bindings to your Role class">
		<description>
			Now that you have your "MyRole" class, add, e.g., the following two
			methods:
			<br/><b>public abstract String getAddressee();</b><br/>
			and 
			<br/><b>public void greet() { System.out.println(getAddressee()); }</b><br/>
			These are the Role methods that will be bound in a callout and callin
			binding respectively. Let's add a callout binding:
			<br/><b>getAddressee -&gt; getWorld;</b><br/>
			and a callin binding: 
			<br/><b>greet &lt;- after hello;</b><br/>
			and save your changes. Click the "Click to Complete" button below when finished.
		</description>
	</item>
	
	<item
		title="Add a main method.">
		<description>
			In order to complete your application, add a main method to your Team class:
			<br/><b>public static void main(String[] args) {</b>
			<br/><b>MyTeam myTeam = new MyTeam();</b>
			<br/><b>myTeam.activate();</b>
			<br/><b>new MyBase().hello();</b>
			<br/><b>}</b><br/>
			Click the "Click to Complete" button below when finished.

		<description>
			Congratulations! You have built your first Object Teams program. Now let's run it!
			Open the <b>Run-Configuration</b> by choosing in the menubar <b>Run->Run...</b>. 
			Select <b>New Object Teams Application</b>
			and click the "New" button at the bottom. Your project's name and main-class should
			already be in place, otherwise please add them manually. All other settings can keep
			their defaults, so simply press the <b>Run</b> button and watch the <b>Console</b>
			view appear, showing the application's output!			
			That's it, you are now ready for Object Teams development!
