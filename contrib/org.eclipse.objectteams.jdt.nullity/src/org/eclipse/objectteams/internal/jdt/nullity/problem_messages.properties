### addition for /org.eclipse.jdt.core/compiler/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/compiler/problem/messages.properties
### NULL ANNOTATIONS
910 = Type mismatch: required '@{0} {1}' but the provided value is null
911 = Type mismatch: required '@{0} {1}' but the provided value can be null
912 = Potential type mismatch: required '@{0} {1}' but nullness of the provided value is unknown
913 = Buildpath problem: the type {0} which is configured as a null annotation type cannot be resolved
914 = The return type is incompatible with the @{1} return from {0}
915 = Illegal redefinition of parameter {0}, inherited method from {1} declares this parameter as @{2}
916 = Illegal redefinition of parameter {0}, inherited method from {1} does not constrain this parameter
917 = Missing null annotation: inherited method from {1} declares this parameter as @{2}
918 = Potential null pointer access: The method {0} may return null
919 = Redundant null check: The method {0} cannot return null
