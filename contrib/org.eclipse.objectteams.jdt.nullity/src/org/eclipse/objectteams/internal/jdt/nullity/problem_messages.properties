### NULL ANNOTATIONS
910 = Type mismatch: returning null from a method declared as @{0}
911 = Type mismatch: return value can be null but method is declared as @{0}
912 = Potential type mismatch: insufficient nullness information regarding return value while the method is declared as @{0}
913 = Type mismatch: passing null to a parameter declared as @{0}
914 = Type mismatch: potentially passing null to a parameter declared as @{0}
915 = Potential type mismatch: insufficient nullness information regarding a value that is passed to a parameter declared as @{0}
916 = Type mismatch: assigning null to local variable {0}, which is declared as @{1}
917 = Type mismatch: potentially assigning null to local variable {0}, which is declared as @{1}
918 = Potential type mismatch: insufficient nullness information regarding a value that is assigned to local variable {0}, which is declared as @{1}
919 = Buildpath problem: the type {0} which is configured as a null annotation type cannot be resolved
920 = The return type is incompatible with the @{1} return from {0}
921 = Illegal redefinition of parameter {0}, inherited method from {1} declares this parameter as @{2}
922 = Illegal redefinition of parameter {0}, inherited method from {1} does not constrain this parameter
923 = Missing null annotation: inherited method from {1} declares this parameter as @{2}
924 = Potential null pointer access: The method {0} may return null
925 = Redundant null check: The method {0} cannot return null
